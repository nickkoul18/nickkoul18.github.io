Thank you for stopping by my website. I give you a warm welcome and I introduce myself.

I am a linguist, holding a Bachelor's degree in Philology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
I also have a Master's degree in Linguistics from Leiden University, The Netherlands.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Early Childhood Education at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. My dissertation involves Political Internet Memes, Political Humor, and Identity Construction and Negotiation.

# A linguist's journey in world full of discourse 

My journey in linguistics started in 2015, during my undergraduate studies in the Department of Philology at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. During my undergraduate studies in that specialization, I  came across various fields of the scientific study of language, but pragmatics and sociolinguistics won over the others. Additionally, during my postgraduate studies at Leiden University, not only did I come across the fascinating aspect of argumentation and rhetoric but also humor studies, a part of which I implemented in my MA thesis. This paved the way for delving deeper into humor studies, emphasizing political humor. In this way, I became a PhD candidate at the Department of Early Childhood Education, marking my return after 10 years to the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.

In addition to my academic interests, I enjoy teaching young and adult students. I specialize in teaching Greek as a foreign language, catering to students of all levelsâ€”from beginners just starting their language journey to intermediate and advanced learners looking to refine their skills. My approach focuses on individual needs, ensuring students receive personalized attention and support to achieve their language goals.

I also have a blazing affinity for proofreading and text editing. I focus on enhancing the clarity and coherence of written materials. This process helps authors communicate their ideas more effectively and allows me to engage deeply with diverse texts and styles.

Feel free to reach out to me in my academic email. We can discuss anything linguistic-related. We can also exchange memes; they do serve as study material!
