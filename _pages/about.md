Thank you for stopping by my website. I give you a warm welcome and I introduce myself.

I am a linguist, holding a Bachelor's degree in Philology from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.
I also have a Master's degree in Linguistics from Leiden University, The Netherlands.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Early Childhood Education at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. My dissertation involves Political Internet Memes, Political Humor, and Identity Construction and Negotiation.

# A linguist's journey in world full of discourse 

As a linguist, I like pragmatics, sociolinguistics, argumentation and rhetoric.
I also like teaching. As a private tutor. I teach Greek as a foreign language to beginners, intermediate and advanced students. I also like proofreading and text editing. Feel free to communicate with me.
