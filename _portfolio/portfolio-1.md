title: "Linguistic Editing Projects"
excerpt: 
collection: portfolio
---

Having started from May 2022 onwards, I have collaborated with academics from various disciplines (Classical Philology, Ancient Greek Philosophy, and even Electrical Engineering) to publish academic undergraduate textbooks. My responsibilities included linguistic editing and, in particular, assistance in grammar, syntax, and punctuation. 
1. My first textbook was [Marcus Tullius Cicero â€“ First Speech Against Catiline](https://repository.kallipos.gr/handle/11419/9372).
2. My second one was [The sophists and Socrates](https://repository.kallipos.gr/handle/11419/11866).
3. My third one was [Signals and Systems](https://repository.kallipos.gr/handle/11419/14196).
4. The recent fourth one is [Historic Towns and Historic Settlements](https://repository.kallipos.gr/handle/11419/14210).

Feel free to take a look. There are more to come in the near future.
