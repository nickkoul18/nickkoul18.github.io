I participated in a two-day conference, "The complexities and challenges of satire in today's society," at Roskilde University in Copenhagen, Denmark. The conference was organized by SatiReNet and funded by Independent Research Fund Denmark. My talk was about the social goals that online users achieve through commenting on political satiric videos uploaded by the stand-up comedian and political satirist Christophoros Zaralikos on his YouTube channel, ZaraleaksTV.
