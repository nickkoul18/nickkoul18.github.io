The 35th ISHS conference was my first international conference in the field of Humour Studies. I presented the preliminary findings of my PhD research on the construction and negotiation of political identity on Greek social media, utilizing Greek Political Internet Memes. There were no conference proceedings. I enjoyed the constructive discussions that took place about the interdisciplinary field of Humour Studies and met many humour scholars, which further enriched my academic network.
