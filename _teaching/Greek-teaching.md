<summary>Teaching Greek as a foreign language to beginner, intermediate, and advanced adult students</summary> 

1. **Personalized Learning**: I tailor lessons to my students' goals and provide materials for independent practice.
2. **Meta-language Learning**: Together with my students we explore the mechanisms of the Greek language, enhancing their understanding of grammar and syntax.
3. **Real-world Context**: I include, in my lessons, practical scenarios to help my students connect and familiarize themselves with the Greek-speaking environment.
4. **Support and Encouragement**: I am always available to motivate my students and ensure a positive learning mindset.
